## About

This is a repository used to show demos of CodeFuse models (More information can be found [**Here**](https://github.com/codefuse-ai)). 
So far, we have provided both a video demo and an online interactive demo, allowing you to observe the interaction with CodeFuse models and give them a try.

## Demo Video

*Please note that the English version is under preparation. We appreciate your understanding and patience.*

## How to get

If you are interested in them, you can download our open-source models from [**HF Repo**](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai) or [**ModelScope Repo**](https://modelscope.cn/organization/codefuse-ai). 

Furthermore, you can access our training code in this repository [**MFTCoder**](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/MFTCoder), which enables efficient fine-tuning for multi-task, multi-model, and multi-architecture scenarios.

Additionally, you can access our optimized high-performance inference code in this repository [**FasterTransformer4CodeFuse**](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/FasterTransformer4CodeFuse).
