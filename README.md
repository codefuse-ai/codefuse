- You can also try to install the [CodeFuse-Chatbot](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/codefuse-chatbot) to test our models locally. 

## How to get

If you are interested in them, you can download our open-source models from [**HF Repo**](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai) or [**ModelScope Repo**](https://modelscope.cn/organization/codefuse-ai). 

Furthermore, you can access our training code in this repository [**MFTCoder**](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/MFTCoder), which enables efficient fine-tuning for multi-task, multi-model, and multi-architecture scenarios.

Additionally, you can access our optimized high-performance inference code in this repository [**FasterTransformer4CodeFuse**](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/FasterTransformer4CodeFuse).
